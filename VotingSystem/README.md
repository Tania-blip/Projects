# Java Voting System #
## A short beginner-friendly project ##

### This project has 2 classes: ###
- The main class:
  - I used the Java Scanner class to take the user`s input from the keyboard, as well as his age, name
  - I did some verifications using basic Java operations in order to decide if the person is able to vote
- The GUI class:
  - I used Java Swing for implementing a friendly GUI
  - I developed the "voting system", the user can vote for only one candidate, clicking on a Java Button
  - After the vote is done, in CLI appears a message that announce the candidate that the user voted for
