# Java Voting System #
## A short beginner-friendly project ##

### This project has 2 classes: ###
- The main class, in which I used the Java Scanner class to take the user`s input from the keyboard, as well as his age, name
- I did some verifications using basic Java operations in order to decide if the person is able to vote
