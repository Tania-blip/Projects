# Turing Machine Implementation in C #

### Formally, the Turing Machine comprises two essential elements: ###
- An infinite tape consisting of an infinite set of cells in which characters are written, initialized to a particular character (usually the character "#").
- The read/write head: it moves, according to well-defined instructions, on the tape in 3 positions; to the left (L), to the right (R), or it remains stationary (S).
